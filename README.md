# The Movie Search
With this app, our team created an interactive movie dashboard using the The Movie DB API to pull various movie information, the New York Times API to pull movie review information, and the FourSquare Places API to pull movie theater data close to the user's zip code.

## App Breakdown
This app allows the user to input a movie and zip code. It then uses the three APIs mentioned above to retrieve the information for the selected movie, review, and theaters near the user's zip code. Recent searches are stored in local storage and searches can be performed from within the recent searches modal.
